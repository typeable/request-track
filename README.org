#+TITLE: Request tracking framework
#+AUTHOR: Nick <nick@typeable.io>

* Mechanism

See [[https://github.com/typeable/technical_notes/blob/master/Request%20Tracking/Tracking.org][this note]] for the mechanism description.

* Lower-level API

~request-track~ library provides WAI primitives to handle the passed headers. At the very least you would want to use ~echoMiddleware~ in order to send back the tracking headers in every HTTP reply.

* Servant API

~request-track-servant~ provides combinators to use with Servant. See the haddock documentation for more info.

* Example server

~example-server~ directory contains a simple HTTP server that uses all this stuff.
